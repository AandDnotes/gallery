        <p>Our little house is full of paintings, prints and other items hanging on the walls, plus things on window sills and shelves. None of them are very valuable, but most have some history that is not obvious by looking at them. These pages try to record that history.</p>
        <p>Some items once belonged to other members of the family, so it might be useful to refer to our <a href="https://aanddnotes.github.io/WebPages/family/history/familyTree.html">family tree</a>.</p>
        <p>Click on a room in the panel on the right (hover over it to make it appear) to view the items in that location.</p>
