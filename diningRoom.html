        <p>We bought the wooden apple while on holiday in the Lake District around Borrowdale in 1997. The oval snuff box (which has a hinged lid) is made of three different metals and has the name H Hinxman on the top. It is believed to have been made in the eighteenth century and was owned by one of Angela's ancestors.</p>

        <p>The soapstone duck was bought at <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/255">Fatipur Sikri</a>, which is a World Heritage site, in 1987 during my first visit to India.</p>
        <p>The silver stamp box was bought by Angela's grandmother (Lois Brazil).</p>

        <p>This watercolour painting belonged to Auntie Bay and Uncle Sam (Alcock). We assume that they brought it back from Singapore, but it might just have been something that reminded them of the area. It certainly reminds me of the time that I spent in Malaysia.</p>

        <p>Sally Kindness (her maiden name) is an artist and is the cousin of Uncle Sam. She and her husband live in the Lake District. She gave us this painting when we visited them in 2019. It is a fictitious landscape, but resembles an area that she knows.</p>

        <p>A limited edition print of Steyning High Street, showing the clock tower. We probably bought it not long after moving to Bramber in 1990.</p>
