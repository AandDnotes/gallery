    <p>At the present time, all the paintings in the study are unframed. They are all items that I collected on my travels and things that Angela does not want hanging on the walls around the house. My aim is to frame them and hang them in the study.</p>

        <p>This metal Muffin the Mule puppet was given to me when I was very young. One in better condition and in its original box is now quite valuable. The pencil-carrying train and the collapsed tube (or whatever) were made by Paul when he was at Steyning Grammar.</p>
        <p>The cartoon lorry in the background was a book case that I made for Paul when we lived in Lymm, Cheshire. His was the smallest bedroom and so a book case needed to go on the wall above his bed.</p>

        <p>During my first visit to India in 1987 I bought this painting from a government emporium in Delhi. It is an abstract representation of the Indian god Ganesh (the elephant god).</p>

        <p>In April 2000 I went to Melbourne and Sydney. I was only able to spend a few days in each location (in 2004 I worked in Melbourne for three months), but while in Melbourne I visited St Kilda, which is on the coast and considered to be a bohemian place. This small print reminds me of the area.</p>

        <p>These two paintings on papyrus were bought on one of my visits to Cairo, possibly as late as 2009. The top painting is a scarab beetle, thought, in Egyptian mythology, to push the sun around the earth. So it is associated with 'getting things done'.</p>
        <p>The lower painting is of the Eye of Horus and is believed to ward off sickness. The vulture and the cobra are often used together and seem to be representative of Lower Egypt.</p>

        <p>In 2004 and 2005 I visited Montreal. Luckily on both ocassions it was the summer, but on my first visit I bought this print, more because I liked the style than due to the location.</p>

        <p>During 1999 I spent five months working in Malaysia, not far from Kuala Lumpur. On one ocassion I went to a Malaysian craft museum in KL and bought this oil on canvas painting from the artist. It just seemed typical of the colours of Malaysia. It had to be a small painting so that I could get it into my case.</p>

        <p>In August 2010 I went to Tokyo. I was asked to stay on an extra day to give a presentation to our office staff and so one of the salesmen was asked to take me on a tour of Tokyo. On our tour we came across a small art dealers shop and I bought this wood block hand print as a typical example of traditional Japanese art.</p>

        <p>You can guess where some of these items were obtained, but the oldest acquisition is the 'thunder egg', which apparently is formed over millions of years. It was probably in 1985 that I went to Portland in Oregon to visit and examine a company. While there we took a trip to Mount Hood (which is snow-capped all year) and I bought this thunder-egg. It seems that Oregon is the capital for thunder eggs. You can find out more about thunder eggs <a href="https://www.rockseeker.com/thundereggs/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The little boomerang was bought on my first trip to Australia and the little Budha from <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/255">Fatipur Sikri</a> during my first trip to India in 1987. The little wooden bowl with mother-of-pearl inlay was also bought on that trip. The little shield was something that I made at primary school and the two pieces of wood were collected from a beach on the Pacific coast of California in November 2017. To get to the beach we had to wade through a shallow river, since the stepping stones (piles of rocks) were only in place during the summer, when the water flow was low.</p>
