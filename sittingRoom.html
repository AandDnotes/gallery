        <p>We were given this wooden plate as a wedding present in 1972 by some Canadian friends of Angela's parents.</p>
        <p>The back of the plate has a story about how the killer whales shown on the front got their name.</p>

        <p>Angela made this cross-stitch sampler when were in Lymm. It shows us, including Meg the dog, and our house (the left-hand house of the pair of semi-detached houses). As you can see, it is dated 1987.</p>

        <p>We often stopped for a coffee at the Denbigh winery at Dorking on our way to the M25 or to Bracknell. On one occasion they had a painting exhibition around an upper gallery, where we found this pastel. The scene is from Newlands Corner, which was on our route to Guildford and where we have sometimes stopped.</p>

        <p>We bought this watercolour painting of the Nant Ffrancon valley from a local artist, Jeremy Yates, who lived in Bethesda and was holding an exhibition of his work in 1982. We bought the 'trees and water' painting at the same time.</p>
        <p>The northwales.com web sites says this of the valley.</p>
        <p>"Nant Ffrancon in north Snowdonia boasts outstanding views and a deeply glaciated valley. The valley begins in Cwm Idwal, carrying water from Llyn-y-Cwn to then join the Ogwen Valley below Ogwen Falls on Afon Ogwen. There is a small road to the west side that provides a safe and convienient route for your travels, allowing you to admire the wildlife and explore Bethesda, up to Llyn Ogwen.</p>
        <p>The area has been used frequently in the past as a location for filming for British film-makers, including doubling for the Khyber Pass in the film, <i>Carry on up the Khyber</i>. It has also doubled for the Himalayas in the Doctor Who serial, <i>The Abominable Snowmen</i>."</p>

        <p>This hand painted plate/bowl had belonged to Angela's parents and is about the only item that we have from Angel's Father's house. The house was bombed during the Second World War and so most of the contents were lost.</p>

        <p>Malaysia is famous for items made out of pewter. After working for five months in our Malaysian office in 1999, the Managing Director gave me these coasters as a memento. Not what I would have chosen, but they do show images associated with Malaysia.</p>
