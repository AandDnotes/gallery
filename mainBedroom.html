        <p>This painting had belonged to Auntie Bay and Uncle Sam. They lived in Saltburn in Scotland for a while and so would have had some meaning to them. Perhaps they Knew the scene. For us, it is just a nice painting.</p>

        <p>We bought this small watercolour painting in an art gallery in Beaumaris in the 1980s. It is just a nice, delicate painting.</p>

        <p>A signed, limited edition print (283 of 850) of the sea front in Worthing showing the Dome cinema and the Pavilion at the land-end of the pier. It had belonged to Davids parents.</p>

        <p>This LLadr&#xF3; figurine #4611 of two nuns had belonged to Angela's parents. LLadr&#xF3; figurines can be quite expensive, although this model has been for sale on ebay for between £25 and £60. In the US they seem to be on sale for between $85 and $180. There are some variations with a coloured glaze that seem to be more expensive.</p>

        <p>This necklace was once Angela's Grandfather's watch chain. He was killed in the First World War. You can see the chain in the lower photo. We suspect that the baby is Angela's Mother, but it could be Auntie Bay. We also think that the chain was, at one time, divided into two bracelets.</p>
