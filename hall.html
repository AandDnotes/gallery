        <p>A pestle and mortar that belonged to Auntie Bay and Uncle Sam. They had lived in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and brought back a lot of African carvings.</p>

        <p>This is a limited edition print (number 17 of 50) by a local artist (Kim Adele Fuller). We bought it at an exhibition of works by various artists at Shoreham airport in June 2011. It so happened that the artist was 'manning' the exhibition and she said that it was a gicl√©e print, which is a high quality print, made on archival paper, using pigment-based ink in a high quality ink-jet printer.</p>

        <p>This piece of Chinese embroidery was owned by Auntie Bay. We assume that she and Uncle Sam brought it back from Singapore and that it might have originally been part of the sleeve decoration on a coat or dress.</p>

        <p>We bought this painting from an art exhibition in the 1980s in a hall on the main street of Beaumaris. It is probably by a local artist, but looked typical of the local small cottages and not dissimilar to our cottage, even though ours was in a terrace.</p>

        <p>In January 1987 I took my first trip to India, while working for Ferranti. We spent some time with our agent in Delhi as well as travelling out to Gauhati in Assam in an attempt to win a large control system order. The son of the owner (who had some role in the company) knew that I had been looking for an example of some Indian embroidery to take home and so gave me this peacock as a gift before we left.</p>
